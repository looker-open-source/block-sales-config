# Sales Block

This repository contains views, explores and dashboards that make up the Sales Block.
There are 3 dashboards that come with this block: Sales Overivew, Pipeline Management and Sales Rep Performance, with each dashboard focusing on a specific area of the sales process.

LookML content of this block is remotely included through the Sales Block Config project and is installed through the Marketplace.

The LookML constants are used to specify the name of the schema and connection. They are defined in the Sales
Block Config project.

This Block is modeled on the schema brough in by Fivetran's [Salesforce connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce). It will bring over all the tables that are available in the [Salesforce Schema](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/data_model.htm).
